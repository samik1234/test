To build a complete web application with React from scratch, there are many important details you need to consider:

Code has to be bundled using a bundler like webpack and transformed using a compiler like Babel.
You need to do production optimizations such as code splitting.
You might want to statically pre-render some pages for performance and SEO. You might also want to use server-side rendering or client-side rendering.
You might have to write some server-side code to connect your React app to your data store.
